# [[PEN-200]]

***

## Overview

Penetration Testing with Kali Linux (PEN-200)[^1] is a foundational penetration testing course designed to teach practical, hands-on offensive security skills. The course covers a wide range of topics, including information gathering, vulnerability scanning, exploitation, privilege escalation, post-exploitation, and web application attacks, with an emphasis on creative problem-solving and manual techniques. Students of PEN-200 are invited to take the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) exam to earn the popular entry-level offensive security certification credential.

Students work through a series of lab machines that simulate real-world environments, ultimately preparing for the 24-hour practical OSCP certification exam. The course philosophy encourages the "Try Harder" mindset, fostering persistence, adaptability, and self-guided learning.

## Learning Objectives

* Understand and execute the full penetration testing process: from reconnaissance to reporting
* Identify, enumerate, and exploit common vulnerabilities in Windows and Linux systems
* Perform privilege escalation on compromised hosts using misconfigurations or kernel exploits
* Enumerate and abuse Active Directory misconfigurations in environments simulating an enterprise network
* Develop proficiency with tools such as Nmap[^2], Netcat[^3], Hydra[^4], Metasploit[^5], and custom scripts
* Perform web application attacks, including SQL injection, command injection, and local/remote file inclusion
* In earlier iterations of the course, students learn how to create and modify shellcode, and understand basic buffer overflow concepts (32-bit Windows stack-based BOF)
* Pivot between compromised machines to access internal networks or additional targets
* Document findings clearly and concisely to meet professional reporting standards
* Build resilience and troubleshooting skills through self-directed learning and iterative practice (i.e., the "Try Harder" mindset)
