# [[AD Initial Enumeration Playbook]]

***

## Overview

This playbook provides a structured approach for initial Active Directory (AD) enumeration after gaining access to a domain-joined host. It focuses on gathering essential domain information to establish situational awareness and identify potential attack paths.
## Steps

* [ ] Establish PowerView session
	* [ ] Load PowerView module
	* [ ] Set format enumeration limit: 
		* [[PowerShell - FormatEnumerationLimit]]
	* [ ] Test basic connectivity with `Get-Domain`
* [ ] Enumerate current domain context
	* [ ] Identify current domain and forest
	* [ ] Document domain functional level
	* [ ] Map domain controllers and their roles
* [ ] Identify high-value targets
	* [ ] Enumerate Domain Admins group membership
	* [ ] Check for users with AdminCount=1
	* [ ] Locate computer objects configured for delegation
 * [ ] Map trust relationships
	 * [ ] Document inbound and outbound domain trusts
	 * [ ] Identify forest trusts and their directions
	 * [ ] Note any trust attributes (SID filtering, etc.)
 * [ ] Check for quick wins
	 * [ ] Search for users with SPNs (kerberoasting candidates)
	 * [ ] Find users with DONT_REQ_PREAUTH (ASREP roasting candidates)
	 * [ ] Look for computer accounts with unconstrained delegation
 * [ ] Document findings
	 * [ ] Create target list prioritized by risk/impact
	 * [ ] Note any misconfigurations or weaknesses
	 * [ ] Plan next enumeration phase based on discoveries
