# [[Vault Structure and Note Creation]]

***

## Overview

This guide covers how to create and organize content in the Adversary Simulation Zettelkasten vault using the automated note creation system. You'll learn to add primary/secondary categories, content notes, and custom content types through the interactive workflow.

## Vault Structure

The vault uses a hierarchical organization system with four main directories:

```
.
├── Adversary Simulation Zettelkasten/
│   ├── 000 - Global Index (Start Here!).md
│   ├── 01 - Primary Categories/
│   │   ├── Primary Category 1.md
│   │   └── Primary Category 2.md
│   ├── 02 - Secondary Categories/
│   │   ├── Secondary Category 1.md
│   │   └── Secondary Category 2.md
│   ├── 03 - Content/
│   │   ├── Note 1.md
│   │   ├── Note 2.md
│   │   └── Note 3.md
│   └── 04 - Templates/
│       ├── 04 - Content/
│       │   ├── 04 - Basic/
│       │   │   ├── Body.md
│       │   │   ├── Footer.md

│       │       ├── Body.md
│       │       ├── Footer.md
│       │       └── Metadata.md
│       ├── 04 - Primary Category/
|       │   ├── Body.md

└── README.md
```

### Non-Rigid Hierarchical Organization

**Primary Categories** (🥇) represent high-level domains like "Penetration Testing," "Red Team Operations," or "Active Directory." These serve as the main organizational pillars.

**Secondary Categories** (🥈) provide mid-level organization within primary categories, such as "Metasploit," "PowerShell," or "Domain Enumeration."

**Content Notes** (⚛️) are atomic, actionable notes containing specific techniques, tools, payloads, or procedures. Each content note links back to relevant primary and secondary categories.

Whereas in traditional note-taking systems, notes can only have a parent-child relationship with a single parent node, the Zettelkasten system enables flexible many-to-many relationships. Content notes can link to multiple primary and secondary categories simultaneously, secondary categories can relate to several primary domains, and cross-category connections emerge naturally through shared content. This networked approach reflects the interconnected nature of adversary simulation knowledge, where techniques often span multiple domains and tactical procedures may apply across different operational contexts.

### Template System

The template system enables consistent note formatting and automated content generation. Each note type has dedicated templates in the `04 - Templates` directory:

* **Content notes** have three components: Metadata (frontmatter with tags and properties), Body (main content structure), Footer (references, footnotes, and Dataview queries)
* **Primary and secondary categories** use Metadata and Body templates for standardized organization

Custom content types with personalized templates can be created on-demand at the content type selection phase of the note creation workflow.

## Note Creation Workflow

All notes are created using the automated Templater[^1] script. The system guides you through type selection, categorization, and content structuring. To trigger the note creation workflow, right-click any one of the following three directories and select the `New note` option.

1. `01 - Primary Categories`
2. `02 - Secondary Categories`
3. `03 - Content`

### Selecting Note Type

When creating notes, you must choose a note type to ensure consistent structure and organization.

![[vault-structure-01.gif|700]]

Note type selection is mandatory because it determines the note's template structure, search tags, and file system destination. This ensures every content note follows consistent formatting standards and maintains proper vault organization. The system prevents the creation of unstructured notes that could disrupt the knowledge management workflow.

### Primary Categories

Primary categories represent the highest level of organization in your vault. All new notes designated as primary categories will be automatically relocated to the `01 - Primary Categories` directory.

The user will be prompted to provide a valid title for new primary categories. All note titles (including secondary categories and content notes) must be non-empty, not contain illegal characters, be less than 100 characters in length, and not have the same title as another note in its destination directory.

![[vault-structure-02.gif|700]]

If the user fails to provide a valid title within five attempts, they will be prompted to 1) use a fallback option, 2) cancel the note creation workflow, or 3) make a final attempt at providing a valid title. If the user fails to provide a valid title on the final attempt then the fallback option will be used to allow the note creation workflow to continue.

![[vault-structure-03.gif|700]]

Secondary categories and content notes use the same title validation workflow.

#### Search Tag Emoji

Primary categories (and content types, which we will explore later) require emoji selection for visual identification and search tag creation.

![[vault-structure-04.gif|700]]

The emoji selection interface provides categorized options relevant to adversary simulation operations. Each emoji serves as both a visual identifier and part of the searchable tag system.

Users can choose a search tag emoji from the categorized options list. Alternatively, they can select the `"🎲 Random selection"` option to allow the system to handle search tag emoji selection. The user can also manually enter a search tag emoji by selecting the `"✏️ Enter emoji manually"` option.

```ad-tip
The [[Emoji Toolbar]] keyboard will not be available to you when you are redirected to the manual emoji entry system prompt, so it is advised to have your desired emoji copied to your clipboard before this step.
```

#### Emoji Validation and Error Handling

The system validates manual emoji input to prevent tag display issues in Obsidian. Common validation issues include:
* **Zero-width joiner emoji sequences** (👨‍💻, 🕵️‍♂️) may cause tag rendering problems
* **Reserved emojis** (🥇, 🥈, ⚛️) are used for vault administration
* **Multiple characters** or **invisible characters** can break tag functionality

![[vault-structure-05.gif|700]]

The validation system provides specific error messages and suggestions for resolving issues, with options to override warnings for experienced users.

The manual emoji prompt uses a similar five-count retry loop and final attempt option as the title validation workflow. If the user fails to provide a valid emoji within five attempts, they will be prompted to 1) use a fallback option, 2) cancel the note creation workflow, or 3) make a final attempt at providing a valid title. If the user fails to provide a valid title on the final attempt then the fallback option will be used to allow the note creation workflow to continue.

#### Search Tag Implementation

Primary category emojis become part of structured search tags that enable efficient vault navigation. For example, a "Web Application Testing" primary category with the 🌐 emoji creates the tag `🌐Web_Application_Testing`, allowing rapid identification and filtering of related notes throughout the vault.

Content types also implement search tag emojis. For example, a "Lab Setup" content type with the 🧪 emoji creates the tag `🧪Lab_Setup`, and all new notes created using the "Lab Setup" template will be embedded with that search tag.

### Secondary Categories

Secondary categories serve as specialized hubs for related techniques, tools, or procedures within broader primary category contexts. They enable more granular organization without losing the higher-level categorical structure. All new notes designated as secondary categories will be automatically relocated to the `02 - Secondary Categories` directory.

![[vault-structure-07.gif|700]]

#### Linking to Primary Categories

New secondary categories establish relationships with existing primary categories through wiki-link references.

![[vault-structure-08.gif|700]]

This linking system creates a hierarchical knowledge graph where secondary categories inherit context from their primary categories. The multi-select interface allows secondary categories to relate to multiple primary domains when appropriate, supporting complex and non-rigid organizational relationships.

![[vault-structure-09.gif|700]]

### Content

Content notes represent the atomic knowledge units in your vault (e.g., specific techniques, tools, procedures, or observations). All new notes designated as content notes will be automatically relocated to the `03 - Content` directory.

![[vault-structure-10.gif|700]]

#### Category Back-Linking

Content notes establish bidirectional relationships with both primary and secondary categories. The dual-linking system ensures content notes remain discoverable within the broader organizational framework while maintaining their atomic nature.

![[vault-structure-11.gif|700]]

Content notes should focus on a single actionable atomic idea (e.g., a specific command syntax, payload example, configuration steps, or tactical procedure) with bidirectional category relationships supporting both top-down navigation (from categories to content) and bottom-up discovery (from content to related categories).

### Content Types

After back-linking a new content type with primary and secondary categories, the user will be prompted to select a content type for the new content note. All new content types will be automatically relocated to the `03 - Content` directory in their own sub-directory; the sub-directory contains the structural elements `Metadata.md`, `Body.md`, and `Footer.md`.

![[vault-structure-12.gif|700]]

Content types determine the template structure and formatting for content notes. The system supports both existing content types and on-demand creation of new types.

#### Using Existing Content Types

Existing content types provide consistent template structures for common note formats.

![[vault-structure-13.gif|700]]

The "Basic" content type offers a general-purpose template suitable for most content, while specialized types provide focused structures for specific use cases (e.g., tool documentation, payload libraries, or procedure checklists).

#### Creating New Content Types

Custom content type creation enables template personalization for specialized organizational needs. New content types use the same note title and search tag emoji validation loop as other notes.

![[vault-structure-14.gif|700]]

The template structure of a new content type is automatically generated from the "Basic" template. This can be modified after the note creation workflow to introduce new elements to any of the three structural components of the content type. This enables building a library of specialized templates tailored to your specific red team documentation needs

![[vault-structure-15.gif|700]]

Content types enable:
* Consistent information structure across similar notes
* Specialized templates for different data types
* Effective filtering and search capabilities
* Scalable organization as vault content grows

## Best Practices

A structured approach ensures your Adversary Simulation vault scales effectively while maintaining organizational clarity and supporting efficient knowledge retrieval.

### Category Design

* **Primary categories** should represent major operational domains
* **Secondary categories** should focus on sub-domains that can be further broken down into granular notes
* Maintain **logical and non-rigid hierarchical relationships** between primary and secondary categories

### Content Creation

* Keep content notes **atomic and focused** on single concepts
* Use **descriptive titles** that clearly indicate content purpose
* Establish **new categories and relationships** when content spans domains
* Alternatively, **create categories first** and flesh them out with **new content notes**

### Template Management

* Create **specialized content types** for recurring note formats
* Use **self-explanatory emoji selection** that aids visual navigation
* Maintain **template consistency** across related content types

### Search and Organization

* Leverage **emoji-based search tags** for rapid content filtering and querying
* Use **wiki-link relationships** for knowledge graph navigation
* Maintain **consistent naming conventions** across categories and content
