# [[Obsidian - Getting Started]]  

***

## Welcome to Anam0x's Obsidian Zettelkasten!

This vault was inspired by TrustedSec's research on using Obsidian[^1] for collaborative offensive security knowledge management.

```ad-todo
Once the installation and configuration scripts have been set up, add the following line:

``It is recommended that you run the installation and configuration script (`install.ps1` for Windows, `install.sh` for NIX-like systems) prior to using this vault; more instructions are available in the `README.md` file.``
```

If you're just getting started, be sure to check out the complete blog pertaining to Obsidian on TrustedSec's website[^2]. In addition, dig into a few of the resources cited below which go into substantially more detail surrounding many of the how-tos of Obsidian and the benefits of maintaining a digital [[Zettelkasten]].

For instructions on how to add your own content and categories, navigate to the [[Vault Structure and Note Creation]] page. Be sure to check out [[Obsidian - Plugins]] along with the individual pages for the following required vault plugins:

* [[Admonition]]
* [[Dataview]]
* [[Emoji Toolbar]]
* [[Obsidian Git]]
* [[Templater]]

Everyone's learning style is different. It is therefore encouraged that you make your own changes to this vault to best accommodate your preferences and workflow.
